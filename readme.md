# Crafting Interactions TodoMVC Hackathon

## Tonight's mission is to build a TODO app.

The functionality for the TODO app is mostly working. It's based on [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/) which is a website that allows developers to compare javascript frameworks by seeing how each one is used to implement the exact same TODO list. For tonight's class we're using the jQuery version because it's the easiest to pick up and experiment with.

* You can work alone or in a group.
* The project can be found on [codepen](https://codepen.io/jleonard/project/editor/DPErWZ/#0)
* There's a task backlog on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/BWjsmmND/ci-todo). Slack me your email to get invited.



> Below is the readme file from todomvc, the project tonight's class is based on.

# jQuery TodoMVC Example

> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
